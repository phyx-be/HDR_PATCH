# HDR PATCH

A simple PCB allowing you to patch different header pinouts and sizes. Most commonly used to connect a standard JTAG connector to a non-standard connector. It fits both 1.27mm and 2.54mm connectors either as through hole or as surface mount component. The board can also be used as a small prototyping board for SOIC components.
